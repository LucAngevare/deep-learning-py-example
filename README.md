# Neutral, positive or negative deep learning script

This is a quick project I wanted to check out, I've always been kind of interested in machine/deep learning, but especially the theory behind it rather than the practice. Fortunately, Python makes deep learning insanely easy (and pretty quick as well)! I have gathered some "sentiment" data from a [Twitter dataset (SemEval)](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/) and added those to the training set. The test set is kept empty for testing purposes but if you write a test, check if it's correct and automatically kill/reproduce deep learning tasks you might be able to make a really good genetic algorithm type deep learning script! The following 2 modules are required to run this script (you can also install this by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the root of your directory):

```
matplotlib==3.4.1
sklearn==0.0
```

I would like to look for an actual sentiment dataset that connects *emotions* to text instead of neutrality of the text (and I'd rather have a data from another source rather than Twitter ðŸ‘€). This topic is definitely something I would like to research more, if not to make a package based on this for my [BrAIn API](https://github.com/LucAngevare/BrAIn-API) then just for my own interest and knowledge.
